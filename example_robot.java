//________________________USING JOYSTICKS___________________________________________________
//here, you tell the phone what each joystick button means.
//For example, to say that the left joystick controlls a specific motor, follow this:

        float left = -gamepad1.left_stick_y;
/*
Wonder why there is a negative sign before gamepad1?
This is beause when you push the joystick all the wayforeard,
the value that the remote sends is -1.
Weird, right?

The motors will operate from -1 to 1, 1 being forward.(see the range.clip section below)

If you send the joystick data directly to the motors, they'll move backwards
when you press the joystick all the way instead of forward, which is what you would expect.

This way, it avoids all sorts of cunfusion! (*^â–½^*)
*/

//to assign, the right joystick, replace left with right, like this:
        float right = -gamepad1.right_stick_y;
//just replace "left" with "right"!

//We need to assign a cutoff point so that the motors don't overextend themselves. Like so:
        right = Range.clip(right, -1,1);
        left = Range.clip(left, -1,1);



//You have the option to scale down the joystick value so that, when we use the robot, it
// won't rush in its direction too quickly. To use this, make sure that you have the section
// down at the bottom, uncomment the following lines of code, and edit it to how you need.

//It's not necessary though!

//ExMotor = (float)scaleInput(right);
//ExMotor2 = (float)scaleInput(left);




//here is where the phone actually tells the motors to move. Follow this:
        ExMotor.setPower(right);
        ExMotor2.setPower(left);

//______________________________USING BUTTONS_______________________________________________

//Say you want the robot to do something when the a button is pressed. Do this:
        if (gamepad1.a){
//put whatever you want the robot to do in here. For example, I put one of the motors to
// a neutral position.

            ExMotor = 0;

//If you wanna use other buttons, replace "a" with whatever button you would like to use.
